<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
This was my first full-stack CRUD project build by myself, which came with some new and interesting issues. Here are some lessons I had to overcome in the project. 

<ol>
<li>I didn't allow myself to use any html files in the project to fully understand how the jsp files worked in a dynamic web page</li>

<li>how the contoller class is simply the mediator between the user and the application, for example the controller manages the flow between the user interface and the data.</li>
<li>The flow of the application really came full circle during this project and helped me understand were I was asking for data and how the data would appear</li>
<li>How to use a navigation bar and local images that I made in my application</li>
<li>One thing I wished to implement was the image url into my plant class, but I ran into isses with the URL being to long so I left it out until I can figure out a proper way to handle it.</li>
