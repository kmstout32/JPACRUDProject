<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
This was my first full-stack CRUD project build by myself, which came with some new and interesting issues. Here are some lessons I had to overcome in the project. 

<ol>
<li>I didn't allow myself to use any html files in the project to fully understand how the jsp files worked in a dynamic web page</li>

<li>JSP's allow programmers to insert Java code inside of HTML, which is an advantage over regular HTML file.</li>
<li>One missing link in the SQL can make or break one feature</li>
<li>How to use bootstrap in HTML files</li>
<li>The flow of how the program works  </li>
<li>We didn't fully understand how to prevent duplicate POSTs, so we both have agreed that we would like to come back to this application to implement the proper way to redirect</li>
</ol>
